            &quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stubles, or where the doer of deeds
            could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blook;
            who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there
            is no effort without error and shortcomings.Victory&nbsp;nor&nbsp;defeat.
            NBSP stands for no breaking space which will make it that the victory nor defeat doesn't get separated in smaller screens
            wrap all togehter.&quot;
